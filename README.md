# WurstMod-Reloaded
A shiny new WurstMod with shiny new features. WurstMod: Reloaded is an experimental set of tools which allow people to more easily create content for Hot Dogs, Horseshoes and Handgrenades with (mostly) the same access to the game's components as the actual developer.

### Features
* Importing the game's scripts directly into the Unity editor sourced from your local game install
* Exporting scripts written from inside Unity to a game-compatible assembly
* Tools for building and exporting custom levels

### Notes
This project has been slow in development with no deadlines or feature goals. The current plan is to wait on the Game Planner mode to release in H3VR since it will contain many useful features for a toolset such as this.
